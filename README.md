#  FreeRTOS Lab Project

This repository contains a lab-based project using [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/), developed for learning real-time embedded systems. It includes source code for multiple concurrent tasks, peripherals control (PWM, debouncing), and GPIO management using MPLAB X.

##  Features

- Multi-tasking using FreeRTOS primitives
- PWM signal control for peripherals
- Debounced button input
- Modular task separation (`vP1Task`, `vP2Task`, etc.)
- Designed for embedded development using MPLAB X and XC32

##  Getting Started

1. **Clone or Download**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FreeRTOS_Lab_Project.git
````

2. **Open with MPLAB X IDE**

   * Open `FreeRTOS_Lab_Template.X` as a project.
   * Ensure the right device and compiler toolchain (e.g., XC32) are selected.

3. **Build and Program**

   * Build the project.
   * Flash to your microcontroller (e.g., PIC32 or supported MCU).

##  Setup Notes

* This project may rely on FreeRTOS source files or libraries you’ll need to provide in `third_party/`.
* Use a supported Microchip board (e.g., Curiosity Board or PIC32MX series).
